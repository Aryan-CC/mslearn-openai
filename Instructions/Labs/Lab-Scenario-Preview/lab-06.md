# Lab Scenario Preview: Generate responses based on custom injested data

## Lab 06: Use your own data with Azure OpenAI

### Lab overview

The Azure OpenAI Service enables you to use your own data with the intelligence of the underlying LLM. You can limit the model to only use your data for pertinent topics, or blend it with results from the pre-trained model.

In this lab, you will injest custom data into the Azure OpenAI studio and generate AI responses limited to the provided data.

### Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
-   Deploy an OpenAI model within the Azure OpenAI studio
-   Use the power of OpenAI models to generate responses limited to a custom injested data.
