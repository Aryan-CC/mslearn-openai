# Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

Azure OpenAI Service brings OpenAI's generative AI models to the Azure platform, enabling powerful AI solutions with Azure's security and scalability. In this lab, you'll learn to provision Azure OpenAI, deploy models using Azure OpenAI Studio, and create applications like chatbots and language models. You'll act as a developer implementing an app, learning how prompt engineering shapes AI responses. Additionally, you'll explore how the service can generate, debug, comment, and simplify code using natural language prompts.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Get started with the Azure OpenAI Service**: This hands-on exercise aims to teach you the fundamentals of using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate advanced AI models into your apps. You will set up and begin utilizing the Azure OpenAI Service to integrate AI models into the applications.

- **Use Azure OpenAI SDKs in your app**: This hands-on exercise demonstrates how to integrate Azure OpenAI SDKs into your application to improve AI capabilities. You will integrate and use Azure OpenAI SDKs within the application.

- **Utilize prompt engineering in your app**: This hands-on exercise demonstrates how to use prompt engineering methods to improve AI interactions in your application. You will use prompt engineering strategies to enhance the performance and relevance of AI.

- **Generate and improve code with Azure OpenAI Service**: The goal of this hands-on exercise is to demonstrate how to effectively generate and refine code using Azure OpenAI. You will improve your abilities to create and refine code with Azure OpenAI Service tools and approaches.
  
## Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with Azure OpenAI Service, Azure CLI, and REST APIs
- Basic Understanding of AI Concepts

## Architecture

The architecture flow for utilizing Azure OpenAI Service begins with provisioning the Azure OpenAI resource. Using Azure OpenAI Studio, you'll deploy and explore OpenAI models. As a developer, you'll create an app, interacting with Azure OpenAI APIs to process natural language prompts. This involves customizing and fine-tuning pre-trained models to meet specific needs. The models can also generate, debug, comment, and simplify code using natural language prompts, streamlining development and enhancing code quality. This flow covers provisioning resources, deploying models, and integrating them into practical applications.
